# zidl

An IDL Compiler written in Zig.

This is intended as an alternative to more mature projects such as WIDL, for use directly in
the zig compiler.

# Current status

~24% passing or near passing.

```
./check-dir mingw-w64/mingw-w64-headers/include/
Total processed:   316
Skipped (no .h):   7
Minor diffs (<20): 77
Major diffs (â‰¥20): 219
Crashes:           20
```

# Compatibility

The goal of this compiler is to have output parity with WIDL for the mingw-64 header files. Anything
more is not intended to be supported at this stage.
